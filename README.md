Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.
Certainly! Below is a simple Python script using the Pillow library for image processing. Make sure to install Pillow first if you haven't already:
pip install pillow
This script uses a simple encryption and decryption process. You can customize this method or explore other pixel manipulation techniques for more robust encryption.
